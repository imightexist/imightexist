so um, i exist, and i make really shitty stuff. my projects were made for fun so dont be surprised if a project is unfinished or has bugs that might never be fixed

Unfinished projects:
- node-WindowsForms (fixing some child process errors)
- BetterBrowser (finishing the csharp version)
- BetterTimber (this project just started)
- MinecraftJS (once you understand shit it is possible to make one)

Cancelled projects:
- Andrej fucker (honestly not worth making an entire ass bot just to ban some troll that won't fuck off)
- CollabVM Sharp (csharp websocket libraries suck ass plus there is a better version out there)
- BetterVM 2.0 (bettervm was discontinued anyways)
- BotCVM (come on nodejs websocket isnt that hard)
- CollabVM Guide (just use mkcvm)
- Internet Explorer 12 (there are still many issues but usernamee now technically owns this project)
- cvm-windows (just compile the server it isn't hard)
