Feb 2022: so um, i exist, and i make really shitty stuff. my projects were made for fun so dont be surprised if a project is unfinished or has bugs that might never be fixed
-->
this is iexist. he codes. he makes too many repos. he never finishes his projects fully. it is your choice to like iexist.

Cool projects:
<!--- node-WindowsForms (onclick and modify doesn't work, but pretty good nodejs gui framework i guess)
- BetterTimber (ehh might have some issues, maybe a lot)
- BetterVM
- PaintVM-->
- ibot
- minichat
