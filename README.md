Feb 2022: so um, i exist, and i make really shitty stuff. my projects were made for fun so dont be surprised if a project is unfinished or has bugs that might never be fixed
-->
Sep 2022: this is iexist. he codes. he makes too many repos. he never finishes his projects fully. it is your choice to like iexist.
